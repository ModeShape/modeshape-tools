<h3>CND Preference Page</h3>

<p>
The <i>CND Preference Page</i> is used set the CND notation verbosity.
</p>

<p>Here is what the <i>CND Preference Page</i> looks like:</p>

<img src="images/PreferencePage.png" border="0" alt="">

<p>The preference page consists of the following:</p>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td align="right"><strong>Notation Type</strong>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>the notation type that determines the way the CND file is saved</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="right"><strong>Preview Area</strong>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>displays a textual example of the way CND files will be saved using the selected notation type</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
If the notation type is changed, existing CND files would have to be re-saved in the CND editor to be affected by the preference
change.
