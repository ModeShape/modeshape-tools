<h3>Node Types Table</h3>

<p>
The <i>Node Types Table</i> is used to add new and modify existing CND node type definitions. Selecting a node type populates the
details section, the property definitions section, and the child node definitions section of the <a href="Editor.html">CND Editor</a>.
In each of those sections, editors are provided to facility making changes.
</p>

<p>Here is what the <i>Node Types Table</i> looks like:</p>

<p>The table's toolbar contains buttons and a search field that do the following:</p>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td align="right"><strong>Name Search Field</strong>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>filters the node types shown in the table by only including those whose names contains the entered text
        (if empty then all are shown)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="right"><strong>Add Node Type</strong>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>opens a dialog that allows a namespace prefix and JCR name to be associated with the new node type definition</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="right"><strong>Delete Node Type</strong>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>deletes the selected node type definition from the CND</td>
