<h2>ModeShape View</h2>

<p>The <i>ModeShape View</i> displays the registered servers hosting ModeShape repositories. For each server, the repositories 
and repository workspaces are also displayed. There are view toolbar buttons to create a new server 
(<img src="images/new_server.gif" border="0" alt="">), edit a selected server's properties 
(<img src="images/edit_server.gif" border="0" alt="">), discard one or more selected servers 
(<img src="images/delete_server.gif" border="0" alt="">), reconnect to a selected server 
(<img src="images/refresh.gif" border="0" alt="">), and collapse all servers so that their repositories and workspaces can't 
be seen (<img src="images/collapse_all.gif" border="0" alt="">). If a connection to a server cannot be established that server 
icon will be decorated with an error overlay image.</p>
