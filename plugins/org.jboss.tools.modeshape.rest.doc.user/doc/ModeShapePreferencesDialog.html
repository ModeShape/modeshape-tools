<h2>ModeShape Preference Pages</h2>

<p>The <i>ModeShape Preference Pages</i> provide settings that allow you to personalize how ModeShape Tools' publishing operations 
are done. A publishing operation occurs when selected files in your local workspace are either uploaded (published) to, or deleted 
(unpublished) from, a specific ModeShape repository workspace. Here's a list of the ModeShape Tools preference pages:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#generalSettingsPrefPage">General Settings</a> - these settings control if published files should be put under 
version control by the ModeShape server.
</li>
<li><a href="#ignoredResourcesPrefPage">Ignored Resources</a> - these settings control which files are filtered out of your
publishing operations.
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="generalSettingsPrefPage">General Settings Preference Page</a></h3>

<p>The <i>General Settings Preference Page</i> currently only has a setting to control if published resources should be versioned
by the ModeShape server. This versioning preference is used by the <a href="PublishDialog.html">Publishing Operations Dialog</a>.</p>

<p>Here is what the <i>ModeShape General Settings Preference Page</i> looks like:</p>

<h3><a name="ignoredResourcesPrefPage">Ignored Resources Preference Page</a></h3>

<p>The <i>Ignored Resources Preference Page</i> is where you identify the name patterns of files and folders that you 
<strong>do not</strong> want involved in your publishing operations.</p>

<p>Here is what the <i>Ignored Resources Preference Page</i> looks like:</p>

<p>If a file name matches one of these patterns, or is found in a folder whose name matches one of those patterns, it will not be 
involved in either a publishing or unpublishing operation. To add new pattern click on the <code>New...</code> button to display 
the following dialog:</p>
