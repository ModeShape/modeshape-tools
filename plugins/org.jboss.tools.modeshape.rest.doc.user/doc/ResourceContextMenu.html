<h2>ModeShape Context Menu</h2>

<p>The <i>ModeShape Context Menu</i> consists of these actions: publish, unpublish, and show published locations. The publish and 
unpublish actions will be enabled when one or more resources (i.e, project, folder, or file) in the workspace are selected. When 
publishing, the selected resources will be uploaded to a ModeShape repository workspace. When unpublishing, the selected resources 
will be removed from a selected ModeShape repository workspace (if they exist there). If a resource has already been published 
using the current Eclipse workspace, the <a href="PublishedLocationsDialog.html">show published locations</a> action will be 
enabled.</p>

<p>Here is what the <i>ModeShape Context Menu</i> looks like:</p>

<p>Files can be filtered out of publishing operations even though they have been selected. Use the 
<a href="ModeShapePreferencesDialog.html#ignoredResourcesPrefPage">Ignored Resources Preference Page</a> to control which files 
are filtered out. If a file name, or the name of the folder they are contained in, or the name of an ancestor folder, match one 
of the patterns identified on this preference page, they will not be included in publishing operations.</p>
